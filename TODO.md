# TODO for Mobile Responsiveness Improvements

- [ ] Add mobile hamburger menu to Header.tsx for navigation on small screens
- [ ] Adjust certificate images in PM Surya Ghar section (Index.tsx) to be responsive width instead of fixed w-64
- [ ] Ensure all text sizes are readable on mobile (e.g., check hero titles)
- [ ] Verify touch targets for buttons and links are adequate (min 44px)
- [ ] Test carousel and accordion on mobile for usability
- [ ] Fix image src in AboutUs.tsx financing section (public/loan.jpg -> /loan.jpg)
- [ ] Add responsive padding/margins where needed for better mobile spacing
